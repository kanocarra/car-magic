#### Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree
The car drives itself, it's almost magic! After a lot of training and testing, the car can successfully maneouver around the track without crashing. This repository contains all code used to train the model to predict steering angles when given an image taken by the car's center camera.

## How it Works

First, lots of data has to be generated by having a human drive the car around a simulated track. From here, the car learns how to steer by modelling how the human responded to the varying bends and terrain. 

The model is a Convolution Neural Network that takes in an image and predicts a steering angle to try stay on the track.

### Network Structure

The network architecture was based off the [NVIDIA model](http://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf) used to train a real-life self drivng car. The model is using regression.

This consists of many convolution layers, normalization, dropouts and several fully connected layers. 

Dropout was used to stop the model from overfitting the data.

Elu was chosen for activation through experimentation. Tanh and relu were tried out but Elu seemed to provide slightly better results.

An Adam optimiser was used to optimise the model for small loss by means of mean squared error. This was chosen as it is best suited for regression models.
